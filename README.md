# Udacity Front-end Nonodegree - Project 
## Baltimore Neighborhood Map


This application is an interactive map of Baltimore, MD with locations that I like marked on the map. When one of the locations are clicked on a popup window will display additional information about that location including the 5 most recent comments from Foursquare.

There is also an  instant search feature to allow the user to search for locations marked on the map.


## How to run this

To run this application, download all of the files and open the index.html file. You will need to be connected to the internet.

To view this interactive map on github pages go to http://szelazny.github.io/udacity_neighborhood_map
