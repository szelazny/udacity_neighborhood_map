## Udacity Front-end Nonodegree - Project 
## Baltimore Neighborhood Map


This application is an interactive map of Baltimore, MD with locations that I am interested in marked on the map. When one of the locations are clicked on a popup window will display additional information about that location including the 5 most recent tips from Foursquare.

There is also a completely integrated instant search feature to allow the user to search through the locations marked on the map.


# How to run

To run this application download all of the files and open the index.html file. For this application to run properly you must be connected to the internet.

To view the interactive map on github pages go to http://szelazny.github.io/udacity_neighborhood_map
